This documents Log2Rot script under src directory

What is it
===========

Log2Rot is a little script useful to convert already exsistent
configuration files of logrotate(8) to the GNU Rot[t]Log syntax.
It should not modify any original file, and will create a new tree
containing converted files.

How it works
============

Log2Rot will make this tree under ETCDIR (see VARIABLES):
    ETCDIR
      |---->monthly.d
      |---->weekly.d
      |---->daily.d
      
Log2Rot reads logrotate.conf and makes a new main rc, monthly,
weekly, and daily file.  It will save each configuration block found
in logrotate.conf in a separate file.  All included files will be
converted too.  If it finds an unsupported parameter, it will comment
the line in the converted config file.

VARIABLES
=========

There is a number of variables that can be modified by the user:

  PREFIX 	
  This is the original basedir containing logrotate.conf and logrotate.d

  ETCDIR	
  This is the to-be-created basedir containing the new tree of converted
  files.

  CONFIG_LOGROTATE
  This is the complete filename of logrotate.conf (the best choice would be
  to leave its value untouched).

  BASE_TMP_DIR
  This is the basedir that will contain temporary files.
