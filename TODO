TODO LIST:
=========

If default rc specifies gzip, or bzip2, rottlog doesn't assume the
extension.  bzip2 and gzip require the extension to function.  Currently,
METAVARIABLES must specify the extension.  Rottlog should support the
extension when specified through rc.

Add support for xz.

PREFIX is /usr/local, but does not allow modification of the prefix
at configure time.  This should be fixed.

Remove cruft.  Rot[t]log needs to be simpler than it is.

Change rotate style to a date format (e.g. foo.log.20100318).
Remove other rotate styles?

Test Log2Rot, virottrc, ConfRottRc.
