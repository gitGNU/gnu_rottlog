TODO LIST:
=========

If default rc specifies gzip, or bzip2, rottlog doesn't assume the
extension.  bzip2 and gzip require the extension to function.  Currently,
METAVARIABLES must specify the extension.  Rottlog should support the
extension when specified through rc.

Add support for xz.

Remove cruft.  Rot[t]log needs to be simpler than it is.

Add rotate style to use a date format (e.g. foo.20100318).

Create default /etc/cron.d/rottlog file for RPM spec file.

Move syntax checking into a separate script; simplify the configuration
files, (do we really need four plus conf files?).

The error codes seem excessive. Unless there is a specific reason for
recording the reason something exited, exit 1.

Verify that log2rot still works with logrotate.conf.
Simplify the log2rot script, and provide a concise usage summary.
Provide a --help and --version option.

Use GNU mktemp, instead of an imbedded TEMPDIR function.

IDEA: Add a log analysis tool, perhaps moving the reporting features
to it.
