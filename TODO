TODO LIST:
=========

ROTT_STATDIR should not be statically defined. Instead, use
coding standards localstatdir variable.

If default rc specifies gzip, or bzip2, rottlog doesn't assume the
extension.  bzip2 and gzip require the extension to function.  Currently,
METAVARIABLES must specify the extension.  Rottlog should support the
extension when specified through rc.

Add support for xz.

Remove cruft.  Rot[t]log needs to be simpler than it is.

Add rotate style to use a date format (e.g. foo.log.20100318).

Create default /etc/cron.d/rottlog file.

Move syntax checking into a separate script; simplify the configuration
files, (do we really need four plus conf files?).

IDEA: Add a log analysis tool, perhaps moving the reporting features
to it.
