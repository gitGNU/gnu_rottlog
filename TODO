TODO and WISHLIST:
=================

If default rc specifies gzip, or bzip2, rottlog doesn't assume the
extension.  bzip2 and gzip require the extension to function.  Currently,
METAVARIABLES must specify the extension.  Rottlog should support the
extension when specified through rc.

/var/log is used for the rc configuration file, though perhaps this
confuses logrotate vs rottlog behaviour.  Should rottlog have its own
archive directory?
