TODO LIST:
=========

If default rc specifies gzip, or bzip2, rottlog doesn't assume the
extension.  bzip2 and gzip require the extension to function.  Currently,
METAVARIABLES must specify the extension.  Rottlog should support the
extension when specified through rc.

Add support for xz.

Remove cruft.  Rot[t]log needs to be simpler than it is.

Change rotate style to a date format (e.g. foo.log.20100318).
Remove other rotate styles?

Test Log2Rot, virottrc, ConfRottRc, MakeSlack.sh. Do we really
need virottrc/ConfRottRc?

Create default /etc/cron.d/rottlog file.

Add a syntax checker and simplify the configuration files, (do we really
need four plus conf files?).

IDEA: Add a log analysis tool, perhaps moving the reporting features
to it.
